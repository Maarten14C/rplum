Description: An approach to age-depth modelling that uses Bayesian statistics to reconstruct accumulation histories for 210Pb-dated deposits using prior information. It can combine 210Pb, radiocarbon, and other dates in the chronologies. See Aquino et al. (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13253-018-0328-7>. Note that parts of the code underlying 'rplum' are derived from the 'rbacon' package by the same authors, and there remains a degree of overlap between the two packages.
